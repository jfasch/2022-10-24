How To ...
==========

Dependencies
------------------

* git (obviously)
* docker (for running it in a common environment)


Get And Initialize
------------------

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://github.com/jfasch/2022-10-24.git
   $ cd 2022-10-24/
   $ git submodule init
   $ git submodule update

VSCode users may skip the next calls and walk on to the VSCode chapter down below.
Run and start the docker to start developing

.. code-block:: console

   $ docker build --tag design-patterns .
   $ docker run -it --rm -v %cd%:/root/2022-10-24/ --name design_patterns_image design-patterns:latest

Build
-----

Create build directory, and change into it.

.. code-block:: console

   $ mkdir /tmp/2022-10-24/
   $ cd /tmp/2022-10-24

Massage source tree, create Makefiles ...

.. code-block:: console

   $ cmake ~/2022-10-24/

Build. First build will take a little longer because ``googletest``
has to be built.

.. code-block:: console

   $ make -j4

Run Tests
---------

In directory ``exercises/``, an executable ``exercises-suite`` is
built. Run that,

.. code-block:: console

   $ ./exercises/exercises-suite 
   Running main() from /home/jfasch/2022-10-24/googletest/googletest/src/gtest_main.cc
   [==========] Running 2 tests from 2 test suites.
   [----------] Global test environment set-up.
   [----------] 1 test from simple_suite
   [ RUN      ] simple_suite.fail
   /home/jfasch/2022-10-24/exercises/simple.cpp:5: Failure
   Expected equality of these values:
     1
     2
   [  FAILED  ] simple_suite.fail (0 ms)
   [----------] 1 test from simple_suite (0 ms total)
   
   [----------] 1 test from threads
   [ RUN      ] threads.future
   [       OK ] threads.future (2000 ms)
   [----------] 1 test from threads (2000 ms total)
   
   [----------] Global test environment tear-down
   [==========] 2 tests from 2 test suites ran. (2000 ms total)
   [  PASSED  ] 1 test.
   [  FAILED  ] 1 test, listed below:
   [  FAILED  ] simple_suite.fail
   
    1 FAILED TEST
   
You see one failing test, and one that passes.

Debug Tests
---------

VSCode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Necessary Extension: Dev Containers**

*Hint:* The commands concerning "Remote Containers" can also appear on the system as "Dev Containers". 

When using VSCode as the preferred IDE, there is already an development kit generated.
After cloning and updating the repository, you can open the folder with VSCode.
During opening there might raise up a pop up, which mentioned, that a development container configuration is present. 

Otherwise you can press **F1 -> Remote Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container**.
This command will create a new VSCode instance **inside** the provided docker image.
Furthermore it will automatically install some predefined extensions for VSCode. 

When it is finished, you can open a new terminal and inside the terminal you will recognise a running linux distribution.
With the preinstalled extensions it is now pretty easy to configure, build and run the relevant targets. 

For configuring the cmake project you only have to press **F1 -> CMake: Configure**.
Building the project on the other hand is **F1 -> CMake: Build**.

For running a requested application you have to change to the folder */tmp/2022-10-24/* and navigate to the application. 

Eclipse
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
